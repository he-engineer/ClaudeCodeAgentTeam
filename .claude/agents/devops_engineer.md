    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment commands
          echo "Deploying to production"
```

- **Performance Impact**: Revenue impact of performance changes

## Alerting Configuration
### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- **Service Down**: Application or database unavailable
- **High Error Rate**: > 1% error rate for 5+ minutes
- **Performance Degradation**: Response time > 2x baseline
