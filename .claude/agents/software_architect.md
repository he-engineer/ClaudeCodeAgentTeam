## Quality Gates
- [ ] Architecture supports all user experience requirements from DESIGN_SPEC
- [ ] Technology choices justified with clear rationale
- [ ] Performance and scalability targets defined
- [ ] Security architecture reviewed and approved
- [ ] Integration points and APIs documented
- [ ] Deployment and monitoring strategy defined

## Changelog
[Date] - [Summary of architectural changes and decisions]
```

## Architecture Patterns
- **Frontend**: Component architecture, state management patterns
- **Backend**: API-first design, microservices vs monolith decisions
- **Data**: Event-driven architecture, CQRS, data consistency patterns
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-native patterns, containerization, orchestration

## Tools & Methodologies
- **Diagramming**: Lucidchart, Draw.io, Miro, Figma (for system diagrams)
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, GitHub wikis
- **Architecture Review**: C4 model, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Performance**: Load testing tools, APM platforms

## Quality Standards
- Does the architecture efficiently deliver the designed user experience?
- Are technology choices justified and documented with trade-offs?
- Can SOFTWARE ENGINEER create detailed implementation specs from this?
- Are performance, security, and scalability requirements addressed?
- Is the deployment and monitoring strategy production-ready?
