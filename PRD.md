## Risks & Dependencies

### High Risk
1. **Restaurant Partnership**
   - **Risk**: Limited restaurant adoption due to commission structure
   - **Mitigation**: Start with 3-5 local restaurants, prove value before scaling
   - **Dependency**: Signed agreements with initial restaurant partners

2. **Payment Integration**
   - **Risk**: Payment processing failures affecting user trust
   - **Mitigation**: Use established providers (Stripe), implement robust error handling
   - **Dependency**: Payment processor approval and integration

### Medium Risk
1. **User Adoption**
   - **Risk**: Insufficient users to form groups consistently
   - **Mitigation**: Launch in single office building, grow organically
   - **Dependency**: Initial user base of 50+ office workers

2. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - **Risk**: Platform-specific issues affecting user experience
   - **Mitigation**: Use React Native, extensive testing on both platforms
   - **Dependency**: React Native framework and development expertise

### Low Risk
1. **Competition**
   - **Risk**: Existing food delivery apps adding group features
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on speed and simplicity, office-specific features
   - **Dependency**: None

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Requirements
- **Mobile App**: iOS 13+, Android 8+
- **Framework**: React Native for cross-platform development
- **Backend**: Node.js with real-time capabilities (Socket.io)
