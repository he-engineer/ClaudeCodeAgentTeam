## 🎯 User Stories Implementation

### Epic 1: Group Formation ✅
- **US-001**: Create meal group with restaurant/time selection ✅
- **US-002**: Join available groups with real-time updates ✅

### Epic 2: Ordering & Payment 🔄
- **US-003**: Browse menu and place group orders (Pending API)
- **US-004**: Split payment automatically (Pending Stripe)

### Epic 3: Pickup & Notifications 🔄  
- **US-005**: Track order status with notifications (Pending push)

## 🚨 Known Issues

### Critical
- Real-time features not implemented (mock data only)
- Payment processing not integrated
- Location services not implemented

### Minor
- Some dependency warnings during installation
- Missing restaurant menu data
- Push notifications not configured

### Performance
- Large list rendering could benefit from virtualization
- Image optimization for restaurant photos pending
- Bundle size optimization needed for production

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data stored locally (pending implementation)
- Payment data will be handled by certified processors
- User authentication tokens need secure storage

### API Security  
- HTTPS enforcement for all network requests
- Rate limiting for group creation/joining
- Input validation on all form submissions

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **App Launch Time**: <3 seconds ⏱️
- **Navigation Performance**: <300ms transitions ⚡
- **Crash-Free Rate**: 99.5% target 📊
- **Bundle Size**: <10MB target 📦

### Business KPIs (From PRD)
- **Average Group Size**: 3+ people target 👥
- **Order Completion Rate**: 85% target ✅  
- **User Retention**: 60% weekly target 🔄
- **Time to Form Group**: <2 minutes target ⏰

## 🚀 Deployment
